# AI-Class-Notice-Automation-Telegram-Bot-Google-Sheets-Gmail
This project implements a seamless, automated workflow to manage and deliver class notices. By simply updating a Google Sheet, the system automatically notifies students via a Telegram bot and sends a final confirmation/summary email through Gmail.

Key Features
Telegram Bot Integration: Sends instant, real-time class announcements and links directly to a Telegram chat or channel.

Google Sheets as Database: Uses a Google Sheet for the centralized, easy-to-manage schedule (Class Name, Date, Time, Link, etc.).

Intelligent Scheduling: Automatically checks the Google Sheet for new or upcoming class entries on a set schedule.

Multi-Channel Notification: Delivers primary notices via Telegram and sends detailed, professional final confirmations or summaries via Gmail.

No-Code/Low-Code Framework: Built using a workflow automation tool like n8n (or similar, if applicable to your project, e.g., Python/Zapier/Make).
